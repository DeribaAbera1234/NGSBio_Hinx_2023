# Next Generation Sequencing Bioinformatics

## Course overview



High throughput sequencing has gained widespread adoption as an essential experimental assay for biological research. Analysing high throughput sequencing data involves an array of different bioinformatics tools and techniques. Therefore, it is important for experimental scientists to have the bioinformatics skills required to effectively assess and analyse data produced by next generation sequencing.

This course aims to provide a hands-on introduction to bioinformatics for next generation sequencing and to equip participants with the essential informatics skills and knowledge required to begin analysing next generation sequencing data and carry out some of the most common types of analysis.

The course programme will start with a history and overview of sequencing technologies and algorithmic theory and principles of bioinformatics, followed by intensive practical computational sessions using sequence analysis techniques and tools applicable to any species or genome size. A variety of applications will be covered from post-sequencing analysis (QC, alignment, assembly, variant calling) to RNA-Seq and data visualisation. Accompanying the lectures and practical sessions will be a series of seminars by invited speakers, who will highlight their cutting-edge work harnessing the power of next generation sequencing technologies to address a wide range of biological questions.

The course aims to provide a hands-on introduction to bioinformatics for next generation sequencing, and should not be considered a complete education in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of the topics.
